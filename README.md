'The current project is a recipe website. There are 4 pages in total, 1 homepage and 3 recipe pages.'

'In the homepage there is an unordered list with 3 anchor elements that link to the recipes'

'In each recipe page there is an anchor element that links to the homepage, an img element with an alt attribute and target attribute, a description of the recipe, an ingredient list and steps for the procedure.'

'Overall everything is working, but I find difficult to make good commit messages. I don't know if I should commit every change I make or maybe commit once a page is ready and working. Guess that I'll get better with time.'

'I feel accomplished even if the website looks not so great and now I am ready to continue with other lessons'
