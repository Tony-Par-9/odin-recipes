        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Pasta alla Norma is a traditional Sicilian first course from Catania, named (legend says) after Bellini’s opera Norma — supposedly because it was "a masterpiece". It’s a rustic dish made with fried eggplant, a simple tomato sauce, and topped with grated ricotta salata. No cream, no garlic confetti, no basil oil foam. Just four ingredients doing their job like they’ve done for a hundred years.

        <h3>Ingredients for 4 servings:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>400g of pasta</li>
            <li>2 medium eggplants</li>
            <li>500g peeled tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 small onion</li>
            <li>A handful of fresh basil leaves</li>
            <li>Ricotta salata grated 100g</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the eggplants: Cut them into slices (either round or lengthwise, 1cm thick), or into large cubes if you prefer. Salt them generously and let them sit in a colander for 30–45 minutes to draw out bitterness. Rinse and pat them dry.</li>
            <li>Fry the eggplants: Heat a good amount of olive oil in a deep pan. Fry the eggplant pieces until golden and tender. Drain them on paper towels. Don’t oven-bake or air-fry if you want the traditional flavor — frying is part of the identity of the dish.</li>
            <li>Make the sauce: In another pan, heat a few tablespoons of olive oil and sauté the chopped onion until soft and translucent. Add the peeled tomatoes (passata or crushed) and let it simmer gently for 15–20 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add a few torn basil leaves toward the end.</li>
            <li>Cooke the pasta: Boil your pasta in well-salted water until al dente. Don’t overcook — this dish hates mushy pasta.</li>
            <li>Assemble: Add the fried eggplant to the sauce and stir gently. Drain the pasta and toss it into the sauce. Mix carefully to avoid breaking the eggplants.</li>
            <li>Serve: Plate the pasta and top each portion with grated ricotta salata and a couple of fresh basil leaves. Serve hot, but it’s also great lukewarm.</li>
        </ol>
