        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Caponata is a classic Sicilian eggplant stew, sweet and sour in flavor, made with fried eggplants, onions, celery, tomatoes, capers, olives, and vinegar. It’s traditionally served at room temperature as an antipasto or side dish, but it can also hold its own as a light main with bread. Every Sicilian family has its version, but this one leans on the traditional Palermo-style.

        <h3>Ingredients for 4 servings:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 medium eggplants</li>
            <li>1 medium onion</li>
            <li>2 celery stalks</li>
            <li>300g canned peeled tomatoes</li>
            <li>100g green olives</li>
            <li>3 tbsp white vinegar</li>
            <li>2 tsp sugar</li>
            <li>fresh basil leaves</li>
            <li>Salt and black pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>Olive Oil</li>

        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prep the eggplants: Cut the eggplants into 2–3 cm cubes. Salt them generously and let them sit in a colander for at least 30 minutes to draw out the bitterness and excess water. Rinse and pat dry thoroughly.</li>

            <li>Fry the eggplants: Heat olive oil in a pan (or deep fryer if you want the proper texture). Fry the eggplant cubes in batches until golden and soft. Drain on paper towels. Don’t skip this — frying gives caponata its signature richness.</li>

            <li>Cook the vegetables: In a separate wide pan, heat 2–3 tbsp olive oil. Sauté the sliced onion until soft and translucent. Add the diced celery and cook for a few minutes. Toss in the tomatoes and cook down for 10–15 minutes until you get a thick sauce.</li>

            <li>Add olives, capers, and balance: Stir in the olives and capers. After a minute, add the sugar and vinegar. Let the vinegar bubble for a bit so it mellows out — this is the agrodolce moment (sweet and sour). Taste and adjust balance — it shouldn’t be too sweet or too sharp.</li>

            <li>Combine everything: Add the fried eggplants to the sauce and mix gently to coat without smashing them. Cook on low for 5 more minutes just to let flavors come together.</li>

            <li>Cool it down: Remove from heat. Add torn basil leaves if using. Let it cool to room temperature — that’s when it really shines. In fact, it’s better the next day.</li>
        </ol>
